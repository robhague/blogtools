# blogtools

Various tools that I use to create and maintain my blog at [http://rob.rho.org.uk](http://rob.rho.org.uk).

## `scripts/migratearchive.py`

An ad-hoc script to extract my pre-2008 blog posts from the generated
HTML and output them in Jekyll format. This script is not an example
of good style, nor does it attempt to be general. It was written
quickly to do the job at hand. However, it may be useful as a source
of ideas if you're trying to do a similar one-time migration.
